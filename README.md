# Qt-Py-Tiny-GPS
GPS using Qt Py board

This project uses an Adafruit Qt Py SAMD21 board, Oak Dev Tech Power Pack, BN-280 GPS unit, SSD1306 OLED and a small lithium battery.

As well as providing GPS info the main reason for this project was to use the U8G2Log function to create a serial type feed of raw GPS data on the tiny OLED, because it looks cool!
